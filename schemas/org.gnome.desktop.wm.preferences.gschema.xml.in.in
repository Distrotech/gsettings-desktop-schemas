      <_summary>Modifier to use for modified window click actions</_summary>
      <_description>
        Clicking a window while holding down this modifier key  will move the
        window (left click), resize the window  (middle click), or show the
        window menu (right click). The middle and right click operations may
        be swapped using the "resize-with-right-button" key. Modifier is
        expressed as <![CDATA["<Alt>"]]> or <![CDATA["<Super>"]]> for example.

        Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar. The value should be a string,
        such as  "menu:minimize,maximize,spacer,close"; the colon separates
        the  left corner of the window from the right corner, and  the button
        names are comma-separated. Duplicate buttons are not allowed. Unknown
        button names are silently ignored so that buttons can be added in
        future metacity versions  without breaking older versions. A special
        spacer tag can be used to insert some space between
        two adjacent buttons.

      <_summary>Window focus mode</_summary>
      <_description>
        The window focus mode indicates how windows are activated.  It has
        three possible values; "click" means windows must  be clicked in order
        to focus them, "sloppy" means windows are focused when the mouse enters
        the window, and "mouse" means windows are focused when the mouse enters
        the window and  unfocused when the mouse leaves the window.

      <_summary>Control how new windows get focus</_summary>
      <_description>
        This option provides additional control over how newly created windows
        get focus.  It has two possible values; "smart" applies the user's
        normal focus mode, and "strict" results in windows started from a
        terminal not being given focus.

      <_summary>
        Whether raising should be a side-effect of other user interactions
      </_summary>
      <_description>
        Setting this option to false can lead to buggy behavior, so users are
        strongly discouraged from changing it from the default of true.  Many
        actions (e.g. clicking in the client area, moving or resizing the window)
        normally raise the window as a side-effect. Setting this option to false,
        which is strongly discouraged, will decouple raising from other user
        actions, and ignore raise requests generated by applications.
        See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445447#c6.

        Even when this option is false, windows can still be raised by an
        alt-left-click anywhere on the window, a normal click on the window
        decorations, or by special messages from pagers, such as activation
        requests from tasklist applets. This option is currently disabled
        in click-to-focus mode. Note that the list of ways to raise windows
        when raise-on-click is false does not include programmatic requests
        from applications to raise windows; such requests will be ignored
        regardless of the reason for the request.

        If you are an application developer and have a user complaining that
        your application does not work with this setting disabled, tell them
        it is -their- fault for breaking their window manager and that they
        need to change this option back to true or live with the "bug"
        they requested.

        Tells the WM how to implement the visual indication that the
        system bell or another application 'bell' indicator has been rung.

        Currently there are two valid values, "fullscreen-flash", which
        causes a fullscreen white-black flash, and "frame-flash" which
        causes the titlebar of the application which sent the bell signal
        to flash.

        If the application which sent the bell is unknown (as is usually
        the case for the default "system beep"), the currently focused
        window's titlebar is flashed.

      <_description>
        If true, then the WM works in terms of applications rather than
        windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an
        application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like Windows.
        When you focus a window in application-based mode, all the windows
        in the application will be raised. Also, in application-based mode,
        focus clicks are not passed through to windows in other applications.
        Application-based mode is, however, largely unimplemented
        at the moment.
